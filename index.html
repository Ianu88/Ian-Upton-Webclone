        <p><img src="./images/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood-1-190x285.jpg" height="300px">
            The foundation of alchemy is based on the law of equivalent 
            exchange; you cannot produce something from nothing. As such,
            alchemy is bound by one taboo - human transmutation. Four
            years ago two young brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, broke
            this taboo when they tried to resurrect their dead mother. During 
            the process Al's body disintegrated and Ed lost his leg. In a 
            desperate attempt to prevent his brother from disappearing 
            completely, Ed sacrificed one of his arms so he could affix Al's 
            soul to a suit of armor. When his missing limbs are replaced by 
            auto mail parts, Ed bears the name of the Fullmetal Alchemist - 
            the youngest ever State Alchemist and dog of the military. Now, 
            alongside his brother, Ed uses his status within the military to 
            attempt to find any way that he can return their bodies back to
             their original state.</p>
